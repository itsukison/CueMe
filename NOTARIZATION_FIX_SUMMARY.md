# Notarization Error Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

Fixed the **HTTP 403 "Invalid or inaccessible developer team ID"** error that occurs during macOS app notarization in GitHub Actions.

## Root Cause

The 403 error typically occurs due to:
1. **Apple ID Permission Issues**: The Apple ID lacks Admin/Account Holder permissions for the specified Team ID
2. **Invalid/Expired App-Specific Password**: The password used for notarization is invalid or expired
3. **Team ID Mismatch**: The Team ID doesn't match the Apple ID's accessible developer teams
4. **Account Status Issues**: Apple Developer Program membership expired or suspended

## Solution Implemented

### ðŸ”§ Enhanced Validation
- Added comprehensive validation for all Apple credentials
- Format validation for Team ID (10-character alphanumeric) and Apple ID (email format)
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### ðŸ”„ Apple ID Notarization
- **Apple ID + App-Specific Password**: Streamlined single method approach
- Simplified configuration with clear validation
- Reduced complexity by focusing on one reliable method

### ðŸ“Š Better Error Handling
- Detailed error analysis and troubleshooting guidance
- Specific detection of 403 notarization errors
- Step-by-step resolution instructions

## Quick Fix

Set these GitHub secrets for Apple ID notarization:
- `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: App-specific password from Apple ID
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your 10-character Team ID

### Steps to Fix:
1. **Verify Apple ID Permissions**:
   - Go to [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
   - Ensure your Apple ID has **Admin** or **Account Holder** role
   - Developer role is insufficient for notarization

2. **Generate New App-Specific Password**:
   - Go to [Apple ID Management](https://appleid.apple.com/)
   - Generate a new App-Specific Password
   - Update `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` secret in GitHub

3. **Verify Team ID**:
   - Check Team ID at: Developer Account â†’ Membership â†’ Team ID
   - Update `APPLE_TEAM_ID` secret if needed

## Required GitHub Secrets

### Code Signing (Always Required)
- `CSC_LINK`: Base64-encoded .p12 certificate file
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`: Password for the .p12 certificate

### Notarization - Apple ID Method
- `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email address
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: App-specific password from Apple ID
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your 10-character Apple Developer Team ID
