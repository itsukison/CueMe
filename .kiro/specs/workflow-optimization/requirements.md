# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the CueMe application workflow to achieve maximum efficiency while maintaining accuracy. CueMe is an AI-powered desktop assistant that processes real-time audio, detects questions, and generates contextual responses for interviews, meetings, and other scenarios. The optimization focuses on reducing latency, improving throughput, and enhancing the overall user experience through strategic performance improvements across all core components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Processing Pipeline Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the audio processing to be ultra-fast so that I can get immediate responses to questions without noticeable delays.

2. WHEN questions are detected THEN the system SHALL refine them algorithmically within 100ms
3. WHEN transcription occurs THEN the system SHALL use optimized Whisper API calls with streaming
4. WHEN multiple questions are detected THEN the system SHALL process them in parallel
5. WHEN audio buffer accumulates THEN the system SHALL use adaptive chunking based on content analysis
6. WHEN silence is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately trigger processing without waiting for timeout

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is processed THEN the system SHALL generate responses in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN using RAG context THEN the system SHALL pre-cache embeddings and use vector search optimization
3. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN the system SHALL execute them in parallel
4. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL use streaming responses where possible
5. WHEN mode-specific responses are needed THEN the system SHALL pre-compile system prompts
6. WHEN similar questions are asked THEN the system SHALL use intelligent caching with TTL

### Requirement 3: Memory and Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run efficiently without consuming excessive system resources so that it doesn't impact my other work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL limit memory usage to under 200MB baseline
2. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction with size limits
3. WHEN handling screenshots THEN the system SHALL compress and optimize images before processing
4. WHEN managing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use efficient vector storage and retrieval
5. WHEN running background processes THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup and garbage collection
6. WHEN idle THEN the system SHALL reduce CPU usage to under 5%

### Requirement 4: Concurrent Processing Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously so that one slow operation doesn't block others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio processing occurs THEN it SHALL run independently of UI operations
2. WHEN LLM calls are made THEN they SHALL not block audio capture or question detection
3. WHEN screenshots are processed THEN they SHALL use separate worker threads
4. WHEN multiple questions are detected THEN they SHALL be processed concurrently
5. WHEN RAG searches occur THEN they SHALL use connection pooling and parallel queries
6. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent task prioritization

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Caching System

**User Story:** As a user, I want frequently used information to be instantly available so that repeated queries don't require re-processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN questions are similar THEN the system SHALL return cached responses within 50ms
2. WHEN embeddings are computed THEN they SHALL be cached with content-based keys
3. WHEN mode configurations are accessed THEN they SHALL be pre-loaded and cached
4. WHEN RAG context is retrieved THEN relevant chunks SHALL be cached for the session
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be cached with appropriate TTL
6. WHEN cache size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL use intelligent eviction strategies

### Requirement 6: Network and API Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want API calls to be as fast as possible so that network latency doesn't slow down my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and keep-alive
2. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL batch compatible operations
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with jitter
4. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent throttling
5. WHEN responses are large THEN the system SHALL use compression and streaming
6. WHEN multiple endpoints are available THEN the system SHALL use load balancing

### Requirement 7: Predictive Pre-processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to anticipate my needs so that responses are ready before I finish asking questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio patterns suggest questions THEN the system SHALL pre-warm LLM connections
2. WHEN question context is detected THEN the system SHALL pre-fetch relevant RAG data
3. WHEN user behavior patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL pre-cache likely responses
4. WHEN mode switches occur THEN the system SHALL pre-compile relevant prompts
5. WHEN screenshots are taken THEN the system SHALL immediately start background processing
6. WHEN conversation context builds THEN the system SHALL maintain relevant context cache

### Requirement 8: Real-time Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance metrics so that I can identify and resolve bottlenecks quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations execute THEN the system SHALL track timing metrics for all major components
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
3. WHEN memory usage spikes THEN the system SHALL capture heap snapshots for analysis
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track response times and error rates
5. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL measure end-to-end latency
6. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL provide performance recommendations

### Requirement 9: Adaptive Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically balance speed and accuracy based on my current needs and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL reduce processing quality to maintain speed
2. WHEN accuracy is critical THEN the system SHALL use higher quality models despite slower processing
3. WHEN network is slow THEN the system SHALL prefer local processing over API calls
4. WHEN battery is low THEN the system SHALL reduce background processing intensity
5. WHEN user is in a meeting THEN the system SHALL prioritize real-time response over perfect accuracy
6. WHEN system resources are abundant THEN the system SHALL use highest quality processing available

### Requirement 10: Seamless Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to continue working even when some components fail or are slow so that my workflow isn't interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached responses or alternative endpoints
2. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to text-only mode
3. WHEN RAG search is slow THEN the system SHALL provide responses without context after timeout
4. WHEN system audio capture fails THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to microphone
5. WHEN LLM responses are delayed THEN the system SHALL provide intermediate status updates
6. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry
