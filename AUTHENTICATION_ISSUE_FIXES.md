# Authentication Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Email Login Not Redirecting Properly ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Email/password login for Electron users wasn't redirecting to the callback page properly.

**Root Cause**: The `handleElectronCallback` function had nested conditional logic that was preventing proper redirection.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified the email login flow in `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- Removed nested conditionals in `handleElectronCallback`
- Ensured all Electron users (both email and OAuth) get redirected to `/auth/callback` page

**Before**: Complex nested logic with duplicate redirectTo checks
**After**: Clean, single-path redirect to callback page for all Electron users

### Issue 2: Google OAuth Not Showing App Launch Button ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: After Google OAuth login, users were redirected to the callback page but the "🚀 CueMeアプリを開く" button wasn't appearing.

**Root Cause**: The OAuth callback wasn't properly handling the hash fragments (`#access_token=...`) from Google's redirect.

**Solution**:
- Improved OAuth token handling in `/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
- Added explicit `handleOAuthCallback()` function to process hash fragments first
- Ensured session is properly set before checking for Electron callback detection
- Fixed the callback flow order: OAuth tokens → Set session → Detect Electron → Show button

**Flow Fixed**:
```
1. Google OAuth redirect → callback page with #access_token=...
2. Extract tokens from URL hash
3. Set Supabase session with extracted tokens  
4. Detect if redirect_to contains 'electron-callback'
5. Show prominent launch button for Electron users
```

## Technical Changes Made

### `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
```diff
- Complex nested logic in handleElectronCallback
+ Simplified redirect logic for all Electron users
- Duplicate redirectTo checks  
+ Single path: redirect to /auth/callback for processing
```

### `/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
```diff
- Basic session check without OAuth handling
+ Explicit OAuth token extraction from URL hash
- Single flow for all callback types
+ Separate handling: OAuth tokens → Session → Electron detection
- Potential missing button for OAuth users
+ Guaranteed button display for all Electron users
```

## Authentication Flow (Final)

### Email/Password Login (Electron)
```
1. User enters email/password in Electron app browser
2. Successful login → handleElectronCallback()
3. Redirect to /auth/callback?redirect_to=electron-callback
4. Callback page detects electron-callback → Shows launch button
5. User clicks "🚀 CueMeアプリを開く" → Launches cueme:// protocol
```

### Google OAuth Login (Electron)  
```
1. User clicks Google login in Electron app browser
2. Google OAuth → /auth/callback?redirect_to=electron-callback#access_token=...
3. Callback page extracts tokens from hash → Sets session
4. Detects electron-callback → Shows launch button
5. User clicks "🚀 CueMeアプリを開く" → Launches cueme:// protocol
```

### Regular Web Users (Both login types)
```
1. User logs in (email or Google)
2. Redirect to /auth/callback?redirect_to=/dashboard
3. Callback page detects dashboard redirect → Auto-redirect to dashboard
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Email Login**: Now properly redirects Electron users to callback page
✅ **Google OAuth**: Properly extracts tokens and shows launch button  
✅ **Web Users**: Continue to work normally (redirect to dashboard)
✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and fallback behavior
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across different browsers

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Fixed OAuth token extraction from URL hash fragments
2. **Consistency**: Both email and OAuth login use same Electron callback flow  
3. **User Experience**: Clear button display for all Electron authentication methods
4. **Error Handling**: Better logging and user feedback throughout the flow
5. **Security Compliance**: Maintains user interaction requirement for protocol launches

Both authentication issues are now resolved and the flow works consistently for all login methods! 🎉
